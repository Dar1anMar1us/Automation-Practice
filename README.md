## ðŸš€ Usage
You need to have node.js installed (v20 LTS); the first time you need to install the required dependencies:

npm install
```

You can run your tests with this command:

```bash
npm test -- <cypress options>

By default chrome is used for the tests, if you want to use another browser use the -b option:

```bash
npm test -- -b firefox
```

You can also launch the Cypress GUI:

```bash
