# ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions, which allows you to run jobs in parallel or sequentially on demand. You can take advantage of this feature to execute automated tests or perform other tasks. Additionally, the actions are designed to persist new user data that is created during the tests in the database.

To run GitHub Actions jobs, navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. From there, you can select the desired workflow and choose to run it in parallel or sequentially. This flexibility allows you to customize the execution based on your needs.

## üîÄ Parallel Execution:

To run jobs in parallel, select the workflow `Run tests in a Matrix` and click on the "Run workflow" button. This will trigger the selected workflow, and multiple jobs will run concurrently.

## üîÅ Sequential Execution:

To run jobs sequentially, select the workflow `Run tests Sequentially` and click on the "Run workflow" button. This will ensure that each job starts only after the previous one has completed.

By leveraging GitHub Actions with parallel or sequential execution, you can efficiently automate your workflows and perform comprehensive testing while persisting new user data in the database. (Also there will be an artifact to download with the new user email:password if the option of persistance is enabled)
